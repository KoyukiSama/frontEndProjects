        This web app is a morsecode textcode mirror, when you put normal text in it, 
        it automatically translates it to morse and if you put text then it will translate it into morse. <br>
        The coolest thing about this app is that you can type anything into the box and it will work as a mirror, even morse and normal text in the same message or even weird characters thrown in. <br>
        This is the first thing I wrote in javascript and is also my first web app. <br>
        Thanks for trying it out!
